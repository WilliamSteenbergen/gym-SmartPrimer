# Smartprimer simulation environment

This repo contains a OpenAI gym environment for simulating high school children doing the follow tasks:
* Doing a pre-test that is scored from 0 to 100
* Use words that correspond to the hint that the child needs
* React to hints that are given to the child by:
    * Quiting
    * Using new words for a new hint
    * Finish the assignment
* Do the post-test



## The children
Every episode in the simulation is a different child. A child is generated as following:

First, we generate a random number between 0 and 14. This will be the child's 'type'. The child's type
determines what hints the child needs:




## The pre test

## Using words

## Reacting to hints

### Quiting
### Using words
### Finish assignment

## The post test
